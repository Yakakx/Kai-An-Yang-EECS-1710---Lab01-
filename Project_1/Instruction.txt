Project 1: Treeman

The grass and the tree will grow up on rainy days. After they grep up, the sun will show up, the background will 
be brighter, and the tree will have a face. The sun will keep moving in a certain location, if you move the watering
can (cursor) to the leaf of the tree, the tree will change its emotion. When you pressed the left mouse button, the 
apple will fell down from the top of the screen.
